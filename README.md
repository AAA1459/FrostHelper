Feature list:

Entities:
- Blue Boosters -> They don't recover your dash
- Yellow Boosters -> They kill you if you don't fastbubble
- Gray Boosters -> They immediately fastbubble you

- Temporary Keys and Keydoors -> They don't persist between deaths
- Static Bumpers -> Like regular ones, but they don't move around randomly. Has customizable sprites, lerp modes for movement
